// a fresh project on mount. The slot has to be emptied once that project owns
// the file, because opening the editor destroys and recreates its window
// (`createEditorWindowWrapper` in electron/main.ts) — so a session left in place
// is imported AGAIN on the next open: a second project on the same recording,
// back at the default padding / roundness / wallpaper, while everything the user
// set and saved stays behind in the first project, which is no longer the one on
// screen. That reads exactly like "the editor forgot my settings" (#364).
//
// `setCurrentRecordingSession(null)` is the existing clear (it also drops the
// derived `currentVideoPath`); the only renderer that still needs the session
// after this point is the CLI runner, which lives in its own process.
