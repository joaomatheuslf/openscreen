 * macOS 26 (Darwin 25) never displays a window that has had
 * `setContentProtection(true)` applied to it.
 *
 * Not "excludes it from captures" — which is the documented behaviour and the
 * whole point — but never paints it for the user either. Confirmed on Darwin
 * 25.5 / Electron 41.2.1 with the HUD: tray icon present, renderer alive and
 * painting (React mounted, no console errors), `ready-to-show` fired, `show()`
 * called, window at valid on-screen coordinates on the main display — and
 * nothing on screen. `showMainWindow()` from the tray and the global shortcut
 * were equally inert, because the window was already "visible" as far as
 * Electron was concerned. Unsetting protection makes it appear instantly; the
 * ordering of protect-vs-show makes no difference, so it is the call itself.
 *
 * `setContentProtection` maps to `NSWindow.sharingType = NSWindowSharingNone`,
 * a path Electron has repeatedly churned on (electron/electron#45990, and
 * PR #46886 reverting a macOS content-protection refactor).
 *
 * Gated on the Darwin major version rather than `darwin` wholesale: the
 * breakage is only *confirmed* on 25.x, and silently dropping protection on
 * older macOS — where it may well work — would be a privacy regression made on
 * no evidence.
 *
 * ScreenCaptureKit ignores `sharingType`, so the native recorder independently
 * excludes the HUD and Notes windows by their native IDs. This call remains the
 * Windows protection and a second line of defence on older macOS releases.
